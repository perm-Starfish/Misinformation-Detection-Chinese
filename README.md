> Detecting Misinformation Using Machine Learning Methods
(2022.8)

## Abstract
With the advances of technology, more information is put on the Internet, and thus the problem of misinformation and fake news is getting more serious. 
In order to distinguish misinformation from real information, many fact checking platforms have been created. 
Machine learning methods have been used for some research on misinformation detection, but most of them were aimed at English information. 
Therefore, we would like to know if they also work on Chinese information. In this research, we chose the most common machine learning methods to conduct the experiment.

## Keywords
- Natural Language Processing
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Count Vectorizer
- Naive Bayes (Multinomial)
- Support Vector Machine

## Future Improvement
- Comparison between more different classifier
- Adopt deep learning methods
- Fix data imbalance
- Ensure that the context of true data and fake data are similar
